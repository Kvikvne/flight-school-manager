# Flight School Schedule Web Application

This is a work in progress project for a flight school schedule web application. The application aims to provide an efficient and user-friendly platform for scheduling flight school lessons.

## Project Status

This project is currently in development. Users can add, edit, and delete their schedules, but more features are to be added.

### Update (BRANCH => scheduleGen-v0.1)
Users now have the capability to generate a basic schedule using their provided information. This schedule is conveniently available as a downloadable CSV file. As part of my future plans, I intend to enhance and modernize this feature, making it even more user-friendly and accessible.

## Reflection

Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features. One of the main challenges I ran into was Authentication. This lead me to spend a few days on a research spike into OAuth, JWT's, and other ways to handle authentication in order to solve this problem.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router, Django, and a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX, and CSS. In the next iteration I plan on adding more custom styles, improving the UX/UI, and adding more features.
