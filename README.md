## Project Status

This project is currently in development. Users can add, edit, and delete their requests and availabilities, but more features are to be added.


## Reflection

This is an on going project that I am at the beginning stages of. The project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features. One of the main challenges I ran into was Authentication. This lead me to spend a few days on a research spike into OAuth, JWT's, and other ways to handle authentication in order to solve this problem.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router, Django, and a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX, and CSS. I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes. In the next iteration I plan on adding the schedule generation feature using data stored in the backend.
